# PPS-Mini-Project-c-
Using this project, we can easily add, view, edit, search, and delete contacts.  We can list contacts by name, phone no., address, and email.  File handling is used to record all data so that after the termination of the program data persists.  Here a data structure is used to store the name, email, and contact.  The coding of the project is short and simple.
